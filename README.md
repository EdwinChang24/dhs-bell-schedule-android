# Davis High bell schedule widget for Android

This is an app that adds a home screen widget showing the current day's bell schedule at Davis High.
Right now it's only available in 4x1.
If you have any experience with making Android widgets,
then please help because I don't know what I'm doing and my UI currently looks terrible.

## Why

I don't see how the school district decided that the new bell schedule makes sense.
The goal of this is to make it easier to adjust to the new schedule.
If anyone wants to make this app better or make an iOS version,
please go ahead because I think a lot of students will want it.
